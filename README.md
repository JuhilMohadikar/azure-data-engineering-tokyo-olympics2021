## ðŸ”„ Data Flow Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Raw CSV files uploaded to **ADLS Gen2** (`raw-data/` folder)

2. **Orchestration with ADF**  
   - **Azure Data Factory** pipelines used to copy data to lake

3. **Data Transformation**  
   - **Databricks Notebooks** used for cleaning, type casting and enrichment
   - Output stored in `transformed-data/` folder

4. **Analytics Layer**  
   - Cleaned data queried in **Azure Synapse Analytics** using serverless SQL pools
